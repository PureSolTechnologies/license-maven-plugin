  license-maven-plugin (PureSol Technologies' License Maven Plugin)
=====================================================================

This is a Maven plugin which checks the license settings in all dependencies
defined in the module for a known and valid license name. As soon as a license
is unknown, this Maven module fails.

This plugin is used to enforce license checks and approval. This is especially
useful for open source projects which need to check their dependencies not to
contain proprietary licenses.
